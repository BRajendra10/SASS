# 🏥 Hospital Website

A fully responsive and interactive hospital website built using **HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript**. The website features animations, a carousel, form validation, an animated navbar, and a well-structured file organization.

## ✨ Features

### 1. 🎨 **Animated Navbar**
- The navbar consists of a **logo, navigation list, and two buttons**.
- **Responsive animation** is applied when the screen width decreases to 1024px.
- The menu items appear with a **flip animation**.
- Clicking the **menu button** (📂) opens the navigation list, and clicking the **close button** (❌) hides it.

### 2. 👨‍⚕️ **Specialist Container Hover Effect**
- Each specialist card contains an **image, name, and social media links**.
- When hovered, a **background overlay appears**, and social media icons become visible.
- The hover effect creates a smooth transition where the background overlay expands from one side, and the social links fade in.
- The **WhatsApp contact button** (📞) appears at the bottom of the card when hovered.

### 3. ✅ **Form Validation with Formspree**
- Integrated **Formspree** for secure and easy form handling.
- Allows data submission without requiring a backend.
- Enhanced validation to ensure user input is correct before submission.
